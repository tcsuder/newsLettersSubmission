# News Letters

### This is a project meant to complete [the coding challenge described here](https://github.com/firstandthird/frontend-challenge) with the additional help of [this sketch document](https://github.com/firstandthird/frontend-challenge/blob/master/assets/newsletter.sketch)

## notes:

1. I chose to follow directions and use absolutely no additional libraries. I tend to like modular css or css in JS options that allow me to be a little less verbose about selectors
2. The form could have been considerably simpler if the goal was not for it to be tabable, but because I wanted to maintain the tabability the form itself gained quite a bit of complexity. I've spent a little time thinking about ways to pass values in or leverage props.children as a way to refactor that the form might remain a modular and reusable piece. Nothing is coming to mind immediately.

## TODO:

- [x] complete submit function
- [x] dry where possible
- [x] select news letter on tile click
- [x] alphabetize
- [x] do some form validation
- [ ] consider further atomization of components
- [x] do you have time for some tests?
- [x] fix scroller on success page
